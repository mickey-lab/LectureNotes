Example: cm vs inches graph (with rounding errors)

reduce data from 2D to 1D: $$x\in\R^2 \rightarrow z\in\R$$

# PCA

want to minimise projected error

+ve unit vector or negative vector doesn't matter because thinking about line

not same as linear regress: linear regress not consider orthogonal distances

## feature scaling/mean normalisation
