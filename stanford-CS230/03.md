steps of an ML project/ application

- select a problem
- get data
- design model
- train model
  - often very iterative process
    - design again + get more data
- test model
- deploy (sell product, etc)
- maintain
- ongoing process: QA (quality ensurence)



idea

- build embeddable devices that you sell to lamp makers or whatever, that (doens't need wifi, etc): you talk directly to the lamp, tell it to turn off or on

advice for selecting projects

- interest
- data (availability, etc)
- domain knowledge (if you a biologist, ya know...)
- utility
- feasibility



get data

- how many days would you spend collecting data, and how you collect data (for embeddable device idea)
- cool to choose a number for estimate out of the fibbonacci sequence (?) lel: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...



what this boi would do

- spend about 1-2 days collecting data
- ML is iterative process
- get a cheap microphone, go around campus say: get them to ppl to say some sentences
  - within 1-2 days, should be ale to collect about 100 examples, can be enough to start working on rudimentary system (prototype)
- problems: accents, reverb, etc
  - then go back and collect more data addressing this
  - after training model = feedback
- boi would recommend collecting data quickly



- literature survey
- tip: keep clear notes on the experiments you've run
- spreadsheet: LR, etc



deployment:

- because of Network Latency, privacy this computation suually done on edge devices as opp to Cloud
- running large NN on embedded device hard
- audio -> simpler algorithm to just detect if a voice is even talking ---> large NN
  - voice activity detection (VAD)
- VAD:
  - non ML system: volume threshold
  - small NN on human speech
  - which one would people choose?
    - opt 1 simple
    - opt 2: other noises (dog barking, etc)
    - opt 2: if someone's whispering
    - opt 2: living near train station?
    - opt 1: cheap (computationally, etc)
    - this boi personally would choose 1



why this boi option 1:

- if first time: opt 1
  - if your first time, quick stuff encouraged
- now that he has done this before, he would do opt 2
- only when you realise that you have the dog barking problem, blablabla, then move to opt 2



shipping

- when you ship a product, data will change
- e.g: train on US accents, but sells well in UK
- manufacturing costs: lower end microphone? etc
- maintenance: get more data



- e.g: web search
  - new prime minister (big culture shift)
  - language itself evolves
- self-driving cars
  - traffic lights look different in different parts of the world
    - (horizontal/vertical traffic lights)
  - signs
- visual inspection in factory
  - new product
  - lighting changes



with this in mind, question again (which system better [more robust] for VAD system)

- (this time more people voted for Non-ML). Why
  - if just measure volume, doesn't take into account accent or anything like that
  - ML system could fail to generalise
  - one thing the Non-ML could fail to generalise in:
    - if a certain group of people typically speak less loudly?
    - unlikely though
  - whereas ML system might make decision based on something found in American accents to decide whether someone is talking at all.

**good note**: if you can just hand-code something, or avoid ML, then might actually be more robust and generalise better than ML algorithms

- there is a rigorous machine learning theory that says that the less parameters you have that it works good for, the better the system would generalise
- with VAD nonML example: theres literally only one parameter



ignoring latency, privacy for the sake of question: does cloud or edge deployment make maintenance easier, why

- most people Cloud
- might not even know if users are unhappy or happy etc
- push changes easier
- gather data: feed back to model

QA

- testing: more statistical way rather than does work or doesn't work
